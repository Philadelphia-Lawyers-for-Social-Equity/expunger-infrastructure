# Expungement Infrastructure

This repo is intended to provide [Docker](https://www.docker.com) files and
any ancillary scripts and tools that will allow us to spin up an instance of
the Expungment tool.

When working, a developer should be able to spin up the entire project by cloning
this repo and executing a `docker-compose run` command.
